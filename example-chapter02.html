	<h1>Best Electric Cars and EVs for 2023</h1>
	<p><b>We rounded up the best of the battery-powered cars just for you.</b></p>
	<h3>In this article...</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The best electric vehicles on the market right now</b></li>
		<li><b>What to know before buying an EV</b></li>
		<li><b>More for people looking to keep their cars in tip-top shape</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're thinking about buying an <i>electric car</i>, there have never been more choices for you than there are
		today.
	</p>
	<p>What began as a <strong>trickle of niche</strong> EVs just a few years ago has become the fastest-growing segment
		of the
		automotive industry. With the <cite>Biden-Harris</cite> administration's <em>plans to build 500,000</em> <abbr
			title="Electric verhicle">EV</abbr> chargers nationwide and
		the tough new <abbr title="Electric verhicle">EPA</abbr> emissions standards, we are rapidly approaching a tipping
		point for EV adoption and growth.
		More than two dozen automakers now offer 40-plus <abbr title="Electric verhicle">EV</abbr> models, boasting at least
		200 miles of range, unique
		high-tech features and, increasingly, performance that outclasses comparable gasoline powered models.</p>
