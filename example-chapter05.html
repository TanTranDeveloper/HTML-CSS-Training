		Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
		Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying
		of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart,
		and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and
		range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m
		(9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living
		species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.
